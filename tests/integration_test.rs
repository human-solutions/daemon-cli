// Integration tests for daemon-rpc
// These tests focus on full end-to-end scenarios that would involve
// separate processes in the final implementation.

// For future Phase 2+ integration tests:
// - Unix socket communication
// - Process spawning and lifecycle
// - Version management across processes
// - Real IPC scenarios

// Currently all Phase 1 functionality is tested via unit tests in each module.
// Integration tests will be added when implementing Phase 2+ features.
